# Cash Flow Analysis Dashboard - Tableau Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains a Tableau Public project that I created as part of a data visualization task. The goal was to analyze and visualize the cash flow data across various dimensions, including monthly totals, geographical locations, and product categories. The resulting visualizations are intended to provide clear insights into the company's revenue streams.

## Visualizations Included

### 1. **Total Monthly Cash Inflows**
   - **Description**: This line chart displays the total monthly cash inflows throughout the year. It highlights the trends and fluctuations in revenue, enabling easy identification of peak and low-performing months.
   - **Insights**: The chart shows a significant drop in revenue during June, with gradual recovery in subsequent months.

### 2. **Total Monthly Cash Inflows by Location**
   - **Description**: A stacked bar chart that breaks down the total monthly cash inflows by geographical location. The locations considered include APAC, EMEA, and the USA.
   - **Insights**: The USA consistently contributes the highest revenue, with APAC showing significant contributions in the first quarter. EMEA has a steady, though smaller, contribution throughout the year.

### 3. **Total Cash Inflows by Product**
   - **Description**: A pie chart depicting the distribution of total cash inflows among different products offered by the company. The products include Customer Success, Main App, Marketing Automation, and Publishing.
   - **Insights**: The Main App and Customer Success products generate the majority of the revenue, indicating their importance to the companyâ€™s overall financial health.
